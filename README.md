Music Genre Classification based on Mel Spectrograms image 
# to do with this project 
step1 the gtzan image datasets of the 10 genre is loaded to the google colab
step2 the image data set is preprocessed like normalization and color space conversion to RGB
step3 train test split is performed 
step4 CNN model is adjusted according to the hyperparameters that makes it to perform well
step5 the training set is fitted to the model and We compiled the CNN model
finally we evaluate the model using test set data and we visualize the model perofmance using
Accuracy / Lose curve
confusion matrix
roc/auc curve

Thank You
